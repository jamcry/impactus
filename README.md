### The problem Impactus solves

In today's world, we face a multitude of social and environmental challenges, from poverty and inequality to climate change and environmental degradation. The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a roadmap to address these challenges, but progress has been slow and uneven. Traditional methods of funding and supporting these goals have proven insufficient, and public engagement in these issues remains low.

Impactus aims to solve these problems by leveraging the power of blockchain technology. It creates a decentralized platform where users can fund projects that contribute to the SDGs. This not only provides a new source of funding for these crucial projects, but also democratizes the process, allowing anyone, anywhere, to contribute to global development goals.

A key innovation of Impactus is the successful extension and implementation of the ERC-1155 standard, which is used for fractional NFTs. This allows us to fractionalize the 17 SDGs into 17 unique NFTs, each of which can be broken down into smaller pieces. This provides a novel way to represent and track contributions to each SDG, and opens up new possibilities for engagement and investment.

Moreover, Impactus addresses the lack of transparency and accountability often associated with charitable donations. With blockchain, every transaction is recorded and visible, ensuring that funds are being used as intended.

Impactus also solves the problem of donor engagement. Traditional donations provide little in return for the donor, beyond the knowledge of having done good. Impactus changes this by providing donors with an NFT that represents the SDG goal their donation supports. This not only serves as a tangible symbol of their contribution, but also has the potential to become a valuable asset in its own right, providing an additional incentive for donation.

Finally, Impactus provides a solution to the problem of project validation.
